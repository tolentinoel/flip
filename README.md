WELCOME TO FLIP!

### Ruby version
    ruby '2.6.1'

### Back-end
    Please refer to `https://github.com/tolentinoel/flip-backend`, go to the flip-backend directory and  link the database by running `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` upon opening the file. Don't forget to run `bundle` or `bundle update` to make sure you have all the dependencies and gems needed(specifically 'rack-cors').

    Run command `rackup` to start the server. It should have a base url of `http://localhost:9292`.

    You can see all users on '/users' and boards through '/boards'. This will make all the data accesible for the game's functionalities.

### Starting up the game

    On another terminal cd into flip-frontend & run `open index.html` this way you can have the app running and be able to play the game!

    Once the server is up and the browser is running, type in your desired player name. Please remember your player name to not lose your game history. Your submitted player name is the way for the database to remember & display your game history when you log back in.

#### Resources:
    -Bootstrap stylesheets
    -FontAwesome stylesheets
    -IconFinder API
    -RickandMorty API
