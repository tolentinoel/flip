### *Back-end
    Please refer to `https://github.com/tolentinoel/flip-backend`, go to the flip-backend directory and  link the database by running `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` upon opening the file. Don't forget to run `bundle` or `bundle update` to make sure you have all the dependencies and gems needed(specifically 'rack-cors').

    Run command `rackup` to start the server. It should have a base url of `http://localhost:9292`.

    You can see all users on /users and boards through /boards. This will make all the data accesible for the game's functionalities.

### *Deployment instructions
